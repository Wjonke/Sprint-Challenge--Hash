# Given a package with a weight limit 'limit' and a list 'weights' of item weights, implement a function
# get_indices_of_item_weights that finds two items whose sum of weights equals the weight limit limit.
# Your function will return an instance of an Answer tuple that has the following form:
#
# (zero, one) where each element represents the item weights of the two packages.
# The higher valued index should be placed in the zeroth index and the smaller index should be placed in the first index.
# If such a pair doesnâ€™t exist for the given inputs, your function should return None.
#
# Your solution should run in linear time.
#
# Example:
#
# input: weights = [ 4, 6, 10, 15, 16 ], length = 5, limit = 21
# output: [ 3, 1 ]  # since these are the indices of weights 15 and 6 whose sum equals 21

# A brute-force solution would involve two nested loops, yielding a quadratic-runtime solution.
# How can we use a hash table in order to implement a solution with a better runtime?
#
# Think about what we can store in the hash table in order to help us to solve this problem more efficiently.
#
# What if we store each weight in the input list as keys?
# What would be a useful thing to store as the value for each key?
#
# If we store each weight's list index as its value, we can then check to see if the hash table contains an entry for
# limit - weight. If it does, then we've found the two items whose weights sum up to the limit!
